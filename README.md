# Predator-Prey Simulation

**Parallel Computing Project**

---

## Overview

This project simulates predator-prey dynamics using a parallel computing approach. It combines a Python-based backend for simulation logic with a TypeScript frontend for visualization, offering an interactive experience to observe ecosystem behaviors.

---

## Features

* **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulates individual predators and prey with distinct behaviors.
* **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes parallel computing to enhance simulation performance.
* **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time graphical representation of the simulation.
* **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust simulation settings to observe different outcomes.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Python
* **Frontend**: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdulmoiz248/Predator-Prey-Simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Predator-Prey-Simulation
   ```
3 **Run this Command in the terminal**
   ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
   ```
   
**Note**: Make sure your docker enigne is runing and env are setup for both frontend and backend
