# Predator-Prey Simulation

**Parallel Computing Project**

---

## Overview

This project simulates predator-prey dynamics using a parallel computing approach. It combines a Python-based backend for simulation logic with a TypeScript frontend for visualization, offering an interactive experience to observe ecosystem behaviors.

## Features

* **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulates individual predators and prey with distinct behaviors.
* **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes parallel computing to enhance simulation performance.
* **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time graphical representation of the simulation.
* **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust simulation settings to observe different outcomes.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Python
* **Frontend**: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS
